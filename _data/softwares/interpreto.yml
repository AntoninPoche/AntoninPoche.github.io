description: |
  Interpreto is a Python library for post hoc explainability of text HuggingFace models, from early BERT variants to LLMs. It provides two complementary families of methods: <strong>attributions</strong> and <strong>concept-based explanations</strong>. The library connects recent research to practical tooling for data scientists, aiming to make explanations accessible to end users. It includes documentation, examples, and tutorials.
  Interpreto supports both classification and generation models through a unified API. A key differentiator is its concept-based functionality, which goes beyond feature-level attributions and is uncommon in existing libraries.
